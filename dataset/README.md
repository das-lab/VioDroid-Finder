App data used in this study contains:

1. Our evaluation targets (discussed in this paper): 600 apps
2. Other apps that are used for creating privacy policy corpus: 40000+ apps

For each app, we provide its privacy policy text, APK file, privacy policy screenshot (of their privacy policy web page)
and their metadata (including app version, app developer, app update time, app download count, privacy policy url,
privacy policy page source code, etc.). 

The privacy policies and metadata of 600 target apps are in `dataset/apps`. 

We present an example in `dataset/apps`:
+ C100003425-1.3.10.apk: the APK file
+ C100003425-1.3.10.json: the app metadata
+ C100003425-1.3.10.txt: the privacy policy
+ C100003425-1.3.10.png: the privacy policy screenshot
